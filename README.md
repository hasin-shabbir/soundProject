# Project Name: Melody
# Project Description:
The project is aimed at allowing the user experience a journey through two countries, Pakistan and Vietnam, through the medium of sound. The theme,
especially the visuals, have been kept simple in order to direct the focus towards sound. The story starts in the form of a conversation between two friends who proceed on
a journey to each other's country through sound. In the journey the user is introduced to the sound culture of each region in both the countries by a narration and the music
of that region being played in the background. The journey ends with a conversation over a light background music, consistent with the light and relaxing theme of the website,
in which the characters compare the music cultures of each other's country. The name of the website, Melody, is selected keeping in mind the melodious tunes the user listens 
to during their journey.
# Process:
The initial thinking process for the story line was pretty much clear in our initial conversation. Therefore, it all came down to the intricacies of implementing the 
concept on the website to create a user experience consistent with the theme and the idea. The journey is a balance between a third person and first person perspective, 
where the conversation between the characters set the tone for the website but then the user becomes incharge and more in control of their journey when presented with the countries. 
Thus, a balance between user control and flow of the website is achieved. Different colors for regions, color changes on hover, and a one-time instruction for each country 
makes the experience simple yet intuitive. To keep the journey specific to what the user wants, it was decided to have the picture and music from the region played in a pop-up like modal that 
opens when a relevant region is clicked. Moreover, it was decided to give user some control over being able to move forward by buttons instead of just keeping the user waiting 
for the sounds to end. To not have an abrupt ending, different ideas came up and then the final idea was decided where the music cultures are compared briefly before giving a sense of continuity 
by asking them if they also want a similar experience for another country. The sounds start with the narration while the background music's volume is lowered, and after the narration 
ends the volume of the music goes up so that relevant audio elements are in focus all the time.
